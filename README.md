# odin-recipes
An assigned project as part of the odin project, but with real and good recipes.

This is a project I plan on developing step by step as I follow the odin project.
I am currently at step 0 and this is how I plan to go about this project:

    0: Set up the repo and layout the plan
    1: Seting up the structure of index.html and the recipe pages
    2: Filling the structure with usfull recipes at least 3 for the begining
    3: Recreating those recipes for proper pictures
    4: Adding a blog to the site about the way I cook and why
    5: Create a visual appiling style using css
    
    As a future maybe I can envison a unit converter to "freedom units" and quantity calculator
